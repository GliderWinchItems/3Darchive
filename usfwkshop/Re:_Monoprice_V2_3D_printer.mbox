Hi Don,

I know it took a while but I got the order number but hopefully you won't
need it!

Order number:

Thanks for the response.  <br>
<br>
I did try the steel push stick several times and even increased the<br>
temperature to 215 C.  When I took the extruder fan/motor off there was<br>
a piece of the old filament protruding slightly above the flare which<br>
pulled out easily with a pair of long nosed pliers.  I think what<br>
happened was when I was unloading the previous filament I pulled too<br>
hard and it separated at a point where the hot end is too cool, but the<br>
filament was partially melted so it stuck.<br>
<br>
A tip--There are two screws that hold the fan, heat sink, and extruder<br>
motor together.  When the two screws are removed there are two spacers<br>
between the heat sink and the metal block.  These fall onto the printer<br>
base and roll into the slot, and down inside.  I was able to retrieve<br>
them with long nose pliers--a bit tedious.  When assembling the parts I<br>
managed to drop one of the spacers and again it rolled down inside,<br>
this time a bit harder to retrieve.  The solution was to place a piece<br>
of paper between the bed rails and base, thus covering the slot and<br>
preventing the spacers from falling into the abyss.<br>
