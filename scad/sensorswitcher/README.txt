switcher_clip

switcher2_clip

These are for mounting the LM2596 dc-dc switcher module on top of the
sensor board.

The LM7805 linear regulator is removed from the sensor board, and wires
run to the switcher module.

The brackets position in the lower-left, over the xtal.

switcher_clip: mounts sidewise and allows access to the header pin pair 
on the board, but requires higher sides on the enclosure.

switcher2_clip mounts flat, but obscures the header pin pair on the board below.
