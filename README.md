# 3Darchive
3D printed items, most of which associate with this general project

Contains all the "junk" accumulated since taking up 3D printing.  Included are notes from a seminar on 3D printing, plus some archiving of material that shipped with the Monoprice IIIP printer.

Most applicable to the general GliderWinchProject are the openscad files in the scad directory.
